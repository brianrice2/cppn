# CPPN

Keras / TensorFlow 2.0 implementation of [hardmaru's CPPN work (Github)][1] / [accompanying blog post - Generating Abstract Patterns with TensorFlow][2]. See his blog post for more detailed background and instructions. A copy of this work is also available as a [notebook on Colab][3] - the extra processing power is great for creating higher dimensional output.
